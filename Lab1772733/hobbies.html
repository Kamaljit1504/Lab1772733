                   Camping: I really like doing camping.Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a tent or a recreational vehicle.
                  Typically we leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment.
                  To be regarded as "camping" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities.
                  Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons. </p> <br> <br> <br>
